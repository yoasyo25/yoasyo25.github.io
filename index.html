        <h1>Hi there!</h1>

        <p>Thanks for stopping. I'm a backend engineering student at the <a href="https://www.turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software &amp; Design</a>. I will be sharing my experience at Turing and beyond on this site. Enjoy!</p>

              <h2>Why Programming</h2>

              <p>During my time as a program officer at the <a href="http://www.ned.org/" target="_blank">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, I observed how organizations and activists who effectively incorporate technology into their programming are able to strengthen their internal capacity, reach broader segments of society, and make greater contributions to social change. I have been especially fascinated by how activists use technology to mobilize citizens, and the ways in which governmental and non-governmental institutions use technology to promote accountability and transparency.</p>

              <p>My interest in learning programming was sparked by a conversation with a colleague about the African Diaspora Coding Academy. Hearing about the coding academy, at a time when I was exploring the next steps in my career, made me realize that programming was not a skillset reserved only for people with a computer science degree and that individuals like me, who come from a social science background, can acquire the skills that will allow them to become web developers.</p>

              <p>During my time at Turing, I have been captivated by the endless possibilities that coding opens up for what I can build and create on a computer. Learning to program has helped me to become a better, more detail oriented, problem solver, and to push myself beyond my comfort zone. I also get to interact with a diverse and inspiring group of people who have a passion for technology. This community is helping me to become a strong and empathetic software developer.
