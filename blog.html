            Module One has consistently presented me with opportunities to stretch myself and grow. The immersive program has helped me learn the foundation of Ruby and has enhanced my ability to think logically and break down problems into small chunks. While there is so much more for me to learn and continually practice, I now have a foundation upon which to build.  My growth is not just evidenced in my ability to understand technical concepts and write code, but also in my resilience to bounce back after “failure” and commitment to pushing through even when I feel like I cannot rise up to the challenges that are being presented to me. Module one has also prompted me to reevaluate how I react to challenges that seem beyond my present capacity and how I respond to moments of frustration/failure in my learning process. I have learned to be more empathetic towards myself, and others, when struggling with a difficult concepts. I have also learned to lean on the Turing community for emotional support and to deepen my learning.

            <p>
            One of the technical concepts that I have found to be rewarding during module one is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). By prompting us to create objects (write methods and classes) that have a single responsibility, this principle helps us reduce dependencies and the costs associated with making changes to our code. By helping us to focus on each single task that we need to our code to accomplish, it makes us focus on the immediate problem and can limit our tendency to be overwhelmed by the totality of what our project requires. SRP helps us write clean code and it makes it easier to fix bugs at later stages. One way to assess whether we are abiding by this principle is to determine if we can clearly describe what each of our methods and classes are responsible for in one sentence.
